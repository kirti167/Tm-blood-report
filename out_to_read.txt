Comment

( Syn: - High Performance Liquid Chromatography, Hb HPLC )

Hb HPLC is used for screening of Beta Thalassemia and detection of many other haemoglobin variants (Hemoglobin E, D Punjab,
Sickle cell anaemia etc.) along with their concentration to establish zygosity.

Normal HbA 2 values can be seen in Alpha Thalassemia trait, silent/ atypical Beta Thalassemia and Beta Thalassemia with iron
deficiency.

A repeat Hb HPLC should be performed after replenishing iron stores in cases with microcytic hypochromic indices.

Advise: -

If there is absence of iron deficiency & persistence of microcytic hypochromic indices, then the possibility of Alpha Thalassemia
trait or silent/ atypical Beta Thalassemia trait cannot be ruled out. Hb HPLC of parents and molecular sequencing of globin genes
are recommended in these cases.
